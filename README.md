A collection of my updated Home Assistant configuration inlucding:

- Node Red Automations
- Esphome configuration
- configuration.yaml
- [A sorted list of all of my automations](/documentation/automation_list.md)
  
Most of my automations are done in Node Red. These automations will be updated regularly when i create, edit or optimise flows. You may need to edit the flows to suit your setup as you won't have some of the same personal entities as i do.  

## My gear

- Raspberry Pi 4B running Home Assistant OS installed on a micro SD card
- Argon40 Pi 4B case with passive and active cooling controlled by Argon40 addon
- External 500GB hard drive for data, media, backups etc

## Additional node red modules

- node-red-contrib-files-and-folders
- node-red-contrib-bigtimer
- node-red-contrib-boolean-logic
- node-red-contrib-cast
- node-red-contrib-image-tools
- node-red-contrib-light-transition
- node-red-contrib-looptimer  

I may not have used them all but I'm not too sure which ones i didn't use so it'll just be a list of custom installed nodes
