A collection of my updated node red home assistant automations.   
You'll find a list of my automations in documentation/automation_list.md or [Here](/documentation/automation_list.md)  
I do most of my automations on node red. These automations will be updated regularly when i create, edit or optimise flows. You may need to edit the flows to suit your setup as you won't have some of the same personal entities as i do.

## My gear:
  - Raspberry Pi 4B running Home Assistant OS installed on a micro SD card
  - External 500GB hard drive for data, media, backups etc

 ## Additional node red modules:
   - node-red-contrib-files-and-folders
   - node-red-contrib-bigtimer
   - node-red-contrib-boolean-logic
   - node-red-contrib-cast
   - node-red-contrib-image-tools
   - node-red-contrib-light-transition
   - node-red-contrib-looptimer
I may not have used them all but I'm not too sure which ones i didn't use so it'll just be a list of custom installed nodes
